**Improvement**

 

**Current: **The main navigation menu on the Ananas homepage is not clearly visible, as promotional banners and discount ads dominate the top of the page.

**Request: **Reposition the main navigation menu above the promotional banners and make it visually distinct by using the green brand color from the Ananas logo as the background. Additionally, keep the menu fixed at the top of the page while scrolling.

 **Reason:** Ensures that users can immediately access key categories and navigate the site more efficiently, rather than being distracted or delayed by promotional content.

 

**Current:** The product name and description are displayed with a font size of only 12px, which is relatively small and makes the text difficult to read — especially for older users and on mobile devices.

**Requested:** Increase the font size of product titles to at least 18px and descriptions to at least 16px. Use a darker text color (e.g., #222 or black) to improve contrast against the light background. Apply these changes both on the product listing cards (grid view) and on the individual product detail page.

**Reason:** Enhancing text readability will improve the user experience, reduce eye strain, and help users make quicker purchasing decisions.

 

**Current:** The product name and description are displayed in small font size, which makes them hard to read.

**Request:** Increase the font size and improve text contrast for product titles and descriptions to ensure better visibility.

**Reason:** Enhancing text readability will improve the user experience, reduce eye strain, and help users make quicker purchasing decisions.

 

**Current:** The "Add to Wishlist" button is only available on the product detail page, positioned next to the "Add to Cart" button. It is represented by a small heart icon in a light gray color, which blends into the background and lacks a descriptive label, making it easy to overlook.

**Request: **Increase the size of the heart icon to at least 24px, add a clear text label (“Add to Wishlist”) next to it, and use a more noticeable color such as the brand green or a dark accent color. Optionally, add a tooltip on hover. Consider relocating the button slightly away from the “Add to Cart” button to make it more distinguishable.

**Reason:** Improving the visibility and clarity of the Wishlist button helps users better understand and use this feature. It also reduces the risk of confusion with other nearby buttons and encourages product saving behavior, contributing to increased user engagement and conversion.

 

**Current: **The "Share product" button with an arrow icon is located on the product detail page, below the product image and near the product title. Its function is not clear until the user clicks on it. The problem exists both on desktop and mobile versions.

**Request:** Add a tooltip that appears on hover and focus for desktop users, positioned above the button with the text “Share this product.” For mobile users, implement a toast message or a brief label that appears when the button is tapped. This ensures the sharing function is clearly communicated on all devices.

**Reason:** Clear labeling and guidance improve user understanding of the share button’s purpose, enhancing the overall user experience and increasing the likelihood of users sharing products. This aligns with the UX principle of recognition over recall.Clear labeling helps users understand the purpose of the button immediately, improving user experience and encouraging sharing.
